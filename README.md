TCP/UDP messaging application written in C++ with I/O multiplexing using poll(). It implements a server that handles multiple clients and a subscriber client that processes commands and receives messages based on topic subscriptions. The system supports efficient message forwarding, client reconnection, and wildcard-based topic matching.
